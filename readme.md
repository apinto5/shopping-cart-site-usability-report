The first usability report that I did with my subject allowed me to scratch out
many of the obvious small issues my website was having. There was a lot of minor
tweaks and issues the site had that I was able to go back into and change. Primarily
the button placement/appearance of the site was subject to change, and the math
in the cart was something that had to change. After these changes were made, I had my
second usability test with a new user. This is the one I will be primarily talking about
here.
Like the previous usability report, the tester gave his first impressions on the site.
He stated that the site gave off very rustic and old vibes. So this tells me that if
I am going for a different feel of the site, I should change things around. And
personally, I do think that is something I would change in the future if I was going to
go back and change the site as a whole. In addition to this, he mentioned that the
cart total placement was in an awkward position, so in the future I would move that to a
more easily legible location. Outside of those two input for the home page, the user
was fairly satisfied with the content on the page. It was easy to look through and
simply to use. The issues began back up after the first page. Some of the validation
in the following pages were not working as intended, and the site would refresh sometimes
when trying to input data. These are two more issues that I would have to work on to
try to get the site working more smoothly. And the final point of interest that the user
would want for me to go over is the final confirmation screen. It is very lackluster and
would benefit from a heavy visual overhaul.
All in all, the second usability report was just as impactful as the first, as it brought
to light many issues that we tended to overlook. If I planned on going back and changing
things in the site, this test brought to me all the things to primarily focus on.
These being: visual overhauls on the overall site layout, complete change of the confirmation
page, and fixing the validation issues that our site had.
